                        <p>  In the heart of Sri Lanka's wilderness, the Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) holds court as the
                            island's sovereign feline. With a golden-yellow coat adorned in bold black rosettes, this endangered
                            species epitomizes both grace and tenacity. Amidst the challenges of habitat loss, poaching, and its
                            endangered status, the Sri Lankan Leopard dynasty persists, a living testament to the island's wild
                            legacy.

                        The Sri Lankan Leopard faces several threats, including habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.

                        and genetic diversity. Conservation efforts are crucial to mitigate these threats and ensure the survival
                        of the species.
